    <p class="lead">Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts, and programmers to understand and re-create/re-implement.[3] </p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading">what is programming? <span class="text-muted">#coding</span></h2>
      <p class="lead">Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing/building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

    <p class="lead">Types of Programming Languages

      Procedural Programming Language. The procedural programming language is used to execute a sequence of statements which lead to a result.
      Functional Programming Language. Functional programming language typically uses stored data, frequently avoiding loops in favor of recursive functions.The functional programing’s primary focus is on the return values of functions, and ...
      Object-oriented Programming Language. This programming language views the world as a group of objects that have internal data and external accessing parts of that data.
      Scripting Programming Language. These programming languages are often procedural and may comprise object-oriented language elements, but they fall into their own category as they are normally not full-fledged programming languages ...
      Logic Programming Language. These types of languages let programmers make declarative statements and then allow the machine to reason about the consequences of those statements.
    
    also here are many specific programming languages like java(for andriod development)  html,css,JavaScript(combinely used to build a static website)
  and many more.</p>
